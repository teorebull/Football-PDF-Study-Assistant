The ball is placed at the center point \\nof the field. Once the referee blows the whistle, a  player from the team that lost the toss \\ntakes the kick-off, and the ball moves forward. This player cannot touch the ball again till any \\nother player from either team touches the ball. During the second half, the teams switch goals \\nand the team that won the toss gets to kick-off.   \\nFootball – Essential Skills  \\nWe have listed here a few essential skills that a player should acquire to become a professional \\nfootballer.  \\n \\nLearn to dribble: It is the  most important act while pl aying the game.

T o pass a ball, you have to kick the ball in a direction where you want it to move. \\nPassing a ball can be done using the inside of your foot , this will give good accuracy and \\nrequire less power. After learning to pass the ball you can master the act by slic ing and \\nhooking the ball to pass it to your teammates.  \\n \\nLearn to shoot: Shooting a ball comes in scene when you are closer to a goal and you need \\nto score a goal. This will need a lot of power and accuracy. You need to set your plant ar foot \\nand aim at the goal and shoot the ball.  \\n \\nTaking the right place on the field is very important.

One should learn to be either tricky, fast, powerful \\nor defensive.  \\nFootball – Rules & Regulations \\nLet’s also understand the rules of the game that are to be followed while playing the game. \\nListed here are some of the major rules and regulations of the game. \\n \\nOffside offence is one of the most important rule to follow in Football. It is basically designed \\nso that the players do not cherry pick or bunch a lot of time near the opponent’s goal. A player \\ncan be said to be in an offside position when he is in the opponent’s half and also behind the \\nlast defender.  \\n \\nThrow-in comes into the game when the ball is either kicked or travels completely outside \\nthe field. The chance of throw-in is given to the team which didn’t last touch it. Throw-in can \\nbe done from the place where the ball is outside the field. Throw -in means to catch the ball \\nwith both the hands behind the head and throw it inside the field.  \\n \\nThe yellow card rules: The yellow card is issued to the players by the referee when a player \\ncommits a mistake. The referee shows the player yellow warning him of his first mistake. If \\na player is shown the yellow card twice then he should leave the game permanently. Reason \\nfor the referee to show the yellow card: \\n \\na) The players who play the game disregarding the rules of the game.  \\n \\nb) Playing dangerously which means hurting the head of the opponent’s team members.  \\n \\nc) Shooting the ball at any player intentionally.  \\nd) Goalkeeper violating the rules of the game by passing the  ball with hands to his \\nteammates when kicked by them.'),\n",

Reasons for the referee to show the red card to a player are: \\n \\na) Physically hurting a player by kicking intentionally.  \\n \\nb) Intentionally jumping on a player. \\n \\nc) Hitting a player or charging a player roughly. \\n \\nd) Pushing or holding a player. \\n \\ne) Handling the ball incorrectly. \\n \\nFree kick: These are given as a penalty for the team players when the opposing team makes \\na foul. There are two types of free kicks: \\n \\nDirect free kick: In this, the ball can be kicked directly into the goal and it doesn’t need to \\nbe passed or touched by the teammate of the kicker.  \\n \\nIndirect kick: In this, the ball must be touched by another teammate of the player who kicks \\nit before scoring a goal.  \\n \\nThe rules of penalty kick: A chance for penalty kick arises when a defending team player \\ncommits a foul in the opposing team’s penalty box. Except the goalie all the other players \\nmust stand in line outside the penalty area. The goalie should stand on the goal line. The ball \\nshould be placed on the penalty spot and then kicked.  \\n \\nCorner kick: A chance for the corner kick arises when the ball goes over the goal line but \\nnot into the goal and was last touched by the defending team member.  \\n \\nGoal kick: When the ball goes over the goal line but not into the goal and was last touched \\nby the attacking team, the ball will be then moved in to the possession of the defending team \\nand the goalie performs the goal kick.'),\n",

The \\nsport has seen some of the best players over decades. Tackle, attack, shoot, and score past the goal \\npost are collective skill sets of champion players. Here is a list of best football players with a brief look \\nat their stats. \\n \\nPele \\n \\nPele alias Edson Arantes do Nascimento is a great Brazilian footballer. He \\nholds the record for being the youngest player to score in the World Cup. At \\nthe age of 17, he opened the goal count against Wales in 1958. Since then, \\nthere was no looking back for him. He represented Santos at club level since \\n1956 and called quits to the game in 1977. He is fondly called as “The King \\nof Football”, and port city Santos celebrates November-19 as Pele day that \\nmarks the day he scored his 1000th goal. \\n \\nGeorge Best \\n \\nBorn in Northern Ireland, George Best , was one of the finest and greatest players of all time. He was \\nequaled with Pele during his playing days. He debuted for Manchester United club at 17. Speed, skill, \\nand aggressive style of play were his attributes. However, his off -field liaisons and life style were too \\nmuch for a club like Manchester United to accept. Hence, he was dropped from the team and later \\ninjuries forced him to quit the game at a very early age of 27. Unfortunately, this legend never got an \\nopportunity to represent his country on bigger stage. \\n \\n \\nDiego Maradona \\n \\nSpeed with technique and a magical left-foot made Argentine football player, \\nDiego Maradona, a legend.  He was called “The Golden Boy of Football”. He \\nstarted playing football at the age of 15 for Argentinos Juniors club. Later, he \\nplayed for Barcelona, Sevilla, and Napoli clubs. He made headlines when he \\nscored a controversial hand-ball goal in 1986 World Cup final. He scored 34 \\ngoals for the national side during his 17-year long career. \\n \\n \\n \\nRonaldo \\n \\nThe Brazilian striker was considered next to Pele in legends of the game. He took part in four World Cup \\nfinals and won twice. Ronaldo is the second highest goal scorer for his nation with 62 goals. He is one \\namongst the players who won FIFA World Player of the Year three or mo re times. Ronaldo won Ballon \\nd’Or twice, once in 1997 and again in 2002. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, and PSV are few popular \\nclubs that he played for and finally retired in 2011 after a long streak of injuries. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9.

The popular saying was coined with  reference to \\nBeckham’s style of bending free -kicks. He was known for his accurate \\npassing and creating opportunities for strikers to net the ball. Beckham \\nstarted playing professional football at the age of 17 for Manchester United. \\nHe captained England for six years. In his 20-year long career, he \\nrepresented top clubs like Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, and PSG other than \\nManchester United. Off the field, he was also popular for his stylish lifestyle \\nand charity. He retired from professional football in 2013. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLionel Messi \\n \\nAfter Maradona from Argentina, Messi is considered as his successor in \\nfootball. Lionel Messi born in 1987 started playing professional football at a \\nvery young age and has already played three World Cups. Speed, technique, \\nand intelligent play are his prime attributes. Alike Maradona, Messi is also \\nknown for his free kicks with left foot. He is yet to win the World Cup for his \\nnational team. Currently, he plays for Barcelona at club level and holds  \\nalmost every club record. Most geniuses of the game have rated him as the \\nbest footballer ever. Lionel Messi has won top FIFA award three times and \\nBallon d’Or four times (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012), which is the highest for any \\nplayer till date. \\n \\n \\nCristiano Ronaldo \\n \\nThe Portuguese football player was born in 1985 and started playing \\nprofessional football at the age of 12. His heroics soon became known \\nglobally and the manager of Manchester United roped him for season \\nof 2003-04. Accurate passing, excellent chop and scissor moves  are \\na couple of his exceptional football playing skills. At club level, he is \\ncurrently playing for Real Madrid and Manchester United was his \\nformer. He is believed to be the best finisher of all time by greats. He \\nheld the record for highest number of goals in European championship \\nfor a long time until Messi broke it.')]"
